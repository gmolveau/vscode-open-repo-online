# VSCode Open Repository Online

**Open Repository Online** is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to easily open the current file in your browser, directly from the online repository. If the current branch has an upstream repository configured, the extension will open the file in the browser using the upstream repository URL. If no upstream is configured, the extension will fallback to the default branch URL. If multiple lines are selected in the current file, the extension will add them to the URL, allowing you to directly view and share the selected lines in the browser.

This extension can be used via the button added in the bottom bar, or via the command palette.

## Getting started

In vscode, search for the `open-repository-online` extension.
