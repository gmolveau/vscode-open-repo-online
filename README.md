# VSCode Open Repository in Browser

**Open Repository in Browser** is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to easily open the current git repository in your browser. If a file is opened, the extension will open the file in the browser using the upstream URL. If no upstream is configured for the current branch, the extension will fallback to the default branch remote URL. If multiple lines are selected in the current file, the extension will add them to the URL, allowing you to directly view and share the selected lines in the browser.

This extension can be used via the button added in the bottom bar, or via the command palette.

## Getting started

In vscode, search for the `Open git repository in browser` (or `ms-gmolveau.open-repository-in-browser`) extension.
